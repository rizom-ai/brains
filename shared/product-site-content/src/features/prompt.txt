Generate a features section for a personal knowledge management system.
The features section should have:
- A clear label (typically "Features")
- A compelling headline that highlights the key benefits
- A brief description that summarizes what the system offers
- Exactly 3 feature cards, where each feature includes:
  - An icon using Lucide icon names (examples: Brain, Search, Lock, Zap, BarChart3, Users, Rocket, Database, FileText, Shield, Star, Heart, etc.)
  - A concise title (2-4 words)
  - A brief description (1-2 sentences explaining the benefit)

For icons, use actual Lucide React icon names (PascalCase). Choose icons that semantically match the feature.
Focus on the core value propositions of knowledge management: organization, searchability, security, and intelligence.
Make the features concrete and benefit-oriented.
