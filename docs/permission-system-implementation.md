# Permission System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating a unified security system in the Brain architecture. The system uses **Shell as Single Security Boundary** pattern where Shell.query() is the only entry point for all secured operations, ensuring consistent permission enforcement across the entire system.

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists

- `UserPermissionLevel` type: `"anchor" | "trusted" | "public"`
- `PermissionHandler` class in `shared/utils/src/permission-handler.ts`
- `MessageContext` interface with optional `userPermissionLevel` field
- Template permission system: `requiredPermission` field on templates
- Tool visibility system: `"public" | "anchor"` on `PluginTool`
- Shell-level permission checking for queries (partial implementation)

### Problem Statement (Updated)

The main remaining security issues are:

- **MCP Tool Permission Filtering**: Tools are registered with visibility levels but not filtered by user permissions - all tools are exposed to all MCP clients
- **Permission Context Missing**: PluginContext.generateContent() uses hardcoded "default-user" instead of actual user permission levels from interfaces
- **Interface Permission Flow**: Permission levels are determined by interfaces but not passed through to content generation

**Note**: The original security gap where PluginContext.generateContent() bypassed Shell permission checking has been **RESOLVED** - PluginContext now correctly routes through Shell.generateContent().

## New Architecture: Shell as Single Security Boundary

### Core Principle

**Shell.generateContent() is the single chokepoint for ALL secured content generation operations**

### Key Insight

Instead of creating complex abstractions, we route all content generation through the existing Shell.generateContent() method which already has proper permission checking implemented.

### Current Secure Architecture (Implemented)

```typescript
// Current security gap:
PluginContext.generateContent() → ContentGenerator (bypasses permissions)

// New secure flow:
PluginContext.generateContent() → Shell.query() → ContentGenerator (with permissions)
```

### Unified Permission Flow

```
User Request → Interface (determines userPermissionLevel) →
PluginContext.generateContent() → Shell.query() → Permission Check → ContentGenerator
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis ✓

- [x] Create this implementation plan document
- [x] Analyze existing permission systems and identify gaps
- [x] Design Security Gateway architecture
- [x] Update implementation plan with unified approach

### Phase 2: Route PluginContext Through Shell ✅ COMPLETED

#### 2.1 Update PluginContext.generateContent Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**File:** `shell/core/src/plugins/pluginContextFactory.ts`

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Implementation already routes through Shell.generateContent()

```typescript
// Actual current implementation (SECURE):
generateContent: async <T = unknown>(
  templateName: string,
  context?: GenerationContext,
): Promise<T> => {
  const namespacedTemplateName = this.ensureNamespaced(templateName, pluginId);
  
  // Always route through Shell.generateContent() for consistent permission checking
  const queryResponse = await shell.generateContent<T>(
    context?.prompt ?? `Generate content using template: ${namespacedTemplateName}`,
    namespacedTemplateName,
    {
      userId: "default-user", // TODO: Pass actual user permission level
      ...(context?.data && { data: context.data }),
    },
  );
  
  return queryResponse;
}
```

**Remaining issue:** Need to pass actual user permission level instead of hardcoded "default-user"

#### 2.2 Remaining Work: Fix Permission Context Flow

**File:** `shell/core/src/shell.ts`

**Enhancement:** Update Shell.query() to handle template-specific requests:

```typescript
// In Shell.query() method, detect template-specific requests:
if (options?.metadata?.templateName) {
  const templateName = options.metadata.templateName as string;
  return this.contentGenerator.generateContent(templateName, {
    prompt: query,
    data: options.metadata,
  });
}
```

### Phase 3: Interface-Specific Permission Implementation

#### 3.1 Keep Existing Interface Base Classes

**File:** `shared/plugin-utils/src/base-plugin.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented with `determineUserPermissionLevel` method

**File:** `shared/plugin-utils/src/message-interface-plugin.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Already populates MessageContext.userPermissionLevel using base plugin method

**No changes needed** - existing implementation is correct for simplified approach

#### 3.2 CLI Interface Implementation

**File:** `interfaces/cli/src/cli-interface.ts`

**Status:** ⏳ To be implemented

**Implementation:**

```typescript
public determineUserPermissionLevel(_userId: string): UserPermissionLevel {
  return 'anchor'; // CLI access is always anchor level
}
```

#### 3.3 MCP Interface Implementation

**File:** Currently no dedicated MCP interface plugin - MCP tools are handled directly by McpServerManager

**Status:** ⏳ Need to clarify tool permission enforcement at MCP level

**Note:** Tools have visibility restrictions ("public" | "anchor") but enforcement point needs clarification

#### 3.4 Matrix Interface Implementation

**File:** `interfaces/matrix/src/matrix-interface.ts`

**Status:** ⏳ To be implemented

**Implementation:**

```typescript
public determineUserPermissionLevel(userId: string): UserPermissionLevel {
  // Use Shell's permission handler for dynamic user-based permissions
  return this.shell.getPermissionHandler().getUserPermissionLevel(userId);
}
```

### Phase 4: Clean Up Unused Permission Code

#### 4.1 Keep Core Permission Infrastructure

**Files to Keep:**

- ✅ Keep permission checking in `shell/core/src/shell.ts` query method (this is our security boundary)
- ✅ Keep MessageContext.userPermissionLevel field (used by existing interfaces)
- ✅ Keep PermissionHandler as-is (no need for SecurityGateway complexity)

**Files to Clean:**

- Remove any Security Gateway implementation attempts
- Remove unused AccessContext interfaces if any were created
- Clean up any complex permission abstractions that aren't needed

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

#### 5.1 PluginContext Security Tests

**File:** `shared/plugin-utils/test/plugin-context-security.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**

- PluginContext.generateContent() routes through Shell.query()
- Permission checking works for plugin-generated content
- Template permission enforcement in plugin context
- User permission level propagation
- Security boundary enforcement

#### 5.2 Integration Tests

**File:** `shell/integration-tests/test/security-integration.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**

- End-to-end security flow through all chokepoints
- Template generation with different permission levels
- Tool execution with different visibility levels
- Resource access with different user levels
- Cross-interface consistency verification
- Permission bypass prevention

#### 5.3 Interface Security Tests

**CLI Tests** (`interfaces/cli/test/security.test.ts`):

- AccessContext creation with "anchor" level
- SecurityGateway integration

**Matrix Tests** (`interfaces/matrix/test/security.test.ts`):

- Dynamic permission level determination
- AccessContext creation based on user ID
- Security boundary enforcement

**MCP Tests** (`interfaces/mcp-server/test/security.test.ts`):

- AccessContext creation with "anchor" level
- Tool access verification through SecurityGateway

#### 5.4 Security Validation Tests

**Test Scenarios:**

- Unauthorized template access attempts via PluginContext.generateContent()
- Tool visibility enforcement at MCP level
- Permission level consistency across interfaces
- Shell.query() as single chokepoint verification
- PluginContext cannot bypass Shell permissions
- Interface permission determination accuracy

## Conclusion

This Shell as Single Security Boundary implementation establishes a simple, robust security architecture that controls access to ALL protected content generation through Shell.generateContent() as the single chokepoint. The architecture has been successfully implemented - PluginContext.generateContent() correctly routes through Shell.generateContent() with permission checking.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Content Generation Security**: Complete and working
- ❌ **MCP Tool Permission Filtering**: Primary remaining gap - tools are not filtered by user permissions
- ❌ **Permission Context Flow**: Secondary gap - hardcoded "default-user" instead of actual user permission levels

The foundation is solid. The remaining work focuses on MCP tool filtering and fixing permission context flow, which are smaller, targeted improvements rather than architectural changes.
