# Topics Plugin Design Document

## Overview

The Topics Plugin provides AI-powered topic extraction, management, and analysis across all content sources in the Personal Brain system. Rather than being limited to conversations, this plugin creates a unified semantic layer that can derive topics from any content type.

## Motivation

Users accumulate knowledge from various sources:
- Conversations (Matrix, CLI, etc.)
- Notes and documents
- Web content and links
- Project files and code

The Topics Plugin unifies these into coherent topics that represent the user's actual areas of interest and knowledge, regardless of source.

## Architecture Decision

We chose to create a general **topics** plugin rather than a **conversation-summary** plugin because:

1. **Unified Knowledge Layer**: Topics should emerge from all content, not just conversations
2. **Better User Value**: Users care about insights and knowledge, not the source
3. **Future Flexibility**: Can easily extend to new content sources
4. **Architectural Alignment**: Fits naturally with the entity model where different content types are unified

## Phase 1: Core Implementation with Conversation Topics

### Topic Entity Schema

```typescript
interface Topic {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  title: string;                 // Human-readable topic name
  description: string;            // Detailed description
  keywords: string[];             // Related keywords/tags
  sources: TopicSource[];         // References to source content
  relevanceScore: number;         // Overall relevance/importance
  firstSeen: Date;               // When topic first appeared
  lastSeen: Date;                // Most recent mention
  mentionCount: number;          // Total mentions across sources
  embedding?: number[];          // Vector for semantic search
  metadata?: {
    autoGenerated: boolean;      // Whether AI-generated or user-created
    mergedFrom?: string[];       // IDs of merged topics
    category?: string;           // User-defined category
  };
}

interface TopicSource {
  type: 'conversation' | 'note' | 'document' | 'link';
  id: string;                   // ID of source entity
  timestamp: Date;              // When mentioned in source
  context?: string;             // Surrounding context
  confidence: number;           // Extraction confidence (0-1)
}
```

### Core Services

#### TopicExtractor
- Uses AI to identify topics from text content
- Extracts keywords and generates descriptions
- Calculates relevance scores
- Generates embeddings for semantic search

#### TopicService
- CRUD operations for topics
- Topic search and filtering
- Source reference management
- Topic lifecycle management

#### TopicMerger
- Identifies similar/duplicate topics
- Merges topics while preserving source references
- Updates relevance scores after merging

### Tools

1. **extract-topics**
   - Extract topics from recent conversations
   - Parameters: time range, minimum relevance score
   - Returns: list of extracted topics

2. **list-topics**
   - List all topics with filtering options
   - Parameters: category, date range, source type
   - Returns: paginated topic list

3. **get-topic-summary**
   - Generate detailed summary for a topic
   - Parameters: topic ID, include sources
   - Returns: topic details with context

4. **search-topics**
   - Semantic search across topics
   - Parameters: query, similarity threshold
   - Returns: ranked topic matches

## Success Metrics

- Number of topics extracted and managed
- Cross-source topic correlations found
- Search relevance improvements

- Reduction in duplicate information

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Batch processing for large conversation histories
- Incremental extraction for new content
- Caching for frequently accessed topics
- Efficient embedding storage and search

### Data Management
- Topic lifecycle (creation, merging, archival)
- Source reference integrity
- Privacy considerations for topic data
- Export/import capabilities

### AI Optimization
- Prompt engineering for accurate extraction
- Model selection for different content types
- Confidence scoring calibration
- Handling ambiguous topics

## Migration Path

For users with existing conversation-memory data:
1. Run extraction job on historical conversations
2. Generate initial topic set
3. Allow manual curation and merging
4. Enable automatic extraction for new content

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for extractors and services
2. Integration tests with mock AI service
3. End-to-end tests with sample conversations
4. Performance tests for large datasets
5. Accuracy tests for topic extraction

## Conclusion

The Topics Plugin provides a powerful semantic layer that unifies knowledge from all content sources. Starting with conversations in Phase 1, it establishes the foundation for a comprehensive knowledge management system that grows more valuable as more content sources are added.
