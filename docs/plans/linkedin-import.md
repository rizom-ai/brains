# Plan: LinkedIn Import

## Status

In progress on `work/professional-profile-v2`. Phase 1A's additive profile schema and
site fallbacks are implemented. Phase 1B's communication-preferences contract,
instruction wiring, public-projection boundary, onboarding ownership change, and
non-destructive legacy-data migration are implemented. Phase 2A's sanctioned PROFILE
snapshot client, deterministic mapper, merge-not-clobber job, confirmation-gated preview
tool, and Rover wiring are implemented. Phase 2B schema inspection is implemented without
exposing member values, and provider-neutral rich-record fingerprint merging is implemented.
Phase 3's optional reviewed narrative distillation is implemented. Phase 4's sanctioned
OAuth authorization-code protocol client, dynamic importer token-provider seam, and a
private-file token store are implemented, while browser routes/state and Rover wiring
remain pending. Rich-domain fixtures/mappers and Phase 5 are not
yet started.

## Context

We want to lower the cost of moving from LinkedIn (LI) into a brain. The naive assumption
— "call the LinkedIn API" — does not hold, and the constraint drives the whole design:

- **LinkedIn's public API gives only basic identity** (OpenID Connect `profile`/`email` →
  `/v2/userinfo`: name, photo, email, headline). Work history, skills, education, and
  connections are not available through it.
- **Third-party scrapers are a dead end.** Proxycurl — the long-time go-to — was sued by
  LinkedIn and shut down (July 2026). The scraper market is legally unstable, per-lookup
  priced, and ToS-violating. Not a foundation for onboarding.
- **The sanctioned path is the DMA Member Data Portability (3rd Party) API.** LinkedIn was
  compelled to build it under EU Digital Markets Act Article 6(9). A member consents via
  3-legged OAuth, and the app pulls their data. This is exactly the "user authorizes a
  third party" model we want.
  - **EEA members only.** Only European Economic Area accounts can consent through this
    API — LinkedIn refuses non-EEA members at the consent step. Non-EEA users need the
    manual export-ZIP fallback. (GDPR Art. 20's export is a right everywhere; DMA's
    real-time API is EEA-only.)
  - Endpoints: **Member Snapshot API** (point-in-time full data by domain) and **Member
    Changelog API** (ongoing events, **28-day** query window).
  - Access requires a one-time developer-app approval (Company Page association + business
    verification). Scope: `r_dma_portability_3rd_party`.

**Snapshot API shape** (confirmed against the LinkedIn docs):

```
GET https://api.linkedin.com/rest/memberSnapshotData?q=criteria[&domain=PROFILE]
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>   Linkedin-Version: 202312
→ { elements: [ { snapshotDomain: "PROFILE", snapshotData: [ { "First Name": "Tom",
    "Last Name": "Cruise", "Headline": "...", "Summary": "...", "Industry": "...",
    "Geo Location": "...", "Websites": "..." } ] } ], paging: {...} }
```

Keys are human-readable title-case strings with spaces. Response is paginated; loop until
"No data found for this memberId". Other domains: `POSITIONS`, `EDUCATION`, `SKILLS`,
`CERTIFICATIONS`, etc.

**The import target already exists.** Owner identity lives in the shell, not a plugin:

- `anchor-profile` — singleton entity, "the profile of the brain's anchor owner"
  (`shell/identity-service/src/anchor-profile-schema.ts`, `AnchorProfileService`). Loaded
  at bootstrap; already consumed by the site, agent-service, and brain-instructions.
- `professionalProfileExtension` — opt-in schema extension parsed from the same
  `anchor-profile` content (`shell/identity-service/src/profile-helpers.ts`), consumed by
  `sites/professional` datasources. A brain model opts in via
  `context.entities.extendFrontmatterSchema("anchor-profile", professionalProfileExtension)`
  (see `brains/rover/src/profile-extension.ts`).

So LinkedIn import writes into `anchor-profile`; no new profile entity is needed.

`brain-character` is a separate singleton with `{ name, role, purpose, values }`. It
represents the brain itself, not its owner. The current Rover onboarding flow stores the
operator's intended content readership (`audience`) and output style (`desiredTone`) on
`anchor-profile`, even though those are communication defaults rather than public profile
facts. They are also not currently loaded by `AnchorProfileService`, whose base parser
only exposes the base profile schema. Phase 1B moves their ownership to an explicit
communication-preferences block associated with brain character while preserving legacy
profile fields during migration.

## Goal

A brain owner connects their LinkedIn account once and their professional identity —
name, headline, industry, location, skills, positions, education, certifications — lands
in their `anchor-profile`, from where profile and site consumers can read it. The import
is idempotent and merge-not-clobber (re-running enriches; it never overwrites deliberate
hand-edits). EEA owners use the sanctioned DMA API; others use a manual export upload.
Communication defaults remain independent of LinkedIn import and are consumed as brain
behavior rather than published owner-profile data.

## Non-goals

- **Connections / other people's data.** The professional _profile_ only. Importing the
  owner's network (other members' PII) is a separate initiative with its own consent and
  privacy story.
- **A generic "any provider" connector.** This is LinkedIn-specific, but built behind a
  pluggable-source seam so other sources can be added later.
- **Third-party scraper integration.** Explicitly rejected (see Context).
- **Multi-tenant token storage.** Each user runs their own brain → a single owner token
  per brain, stored like any other integration credential.

## Architecture

### Identity ownership boundary

| Contract                                   | Owns                                                                                                   | Does not own                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `brain-character`                          | The brain's `name`, brain `role`, `purpose`, and behavioral `values`                                   | The owner's profession or imported LinkedIn history |
| `brain-character.communicationPreferences` | Default content `audience` and output `tone`, overridable per task/channel                             | Public profile facts; values or permissions         |
| `anchor-profile`                           | The owner's public identity, professional `role`/`headline`, narrative, curated expertise, and history | Agent/output preferences or the brain's persona     |
| `positions[].title`                        | A role the owner held at one organization                                                              | The brain's role                                    |

`values` and communication tone remain distinct: values guide decisions and behavior;
tone controls presentation. The role fields are contextual rather than interchangeable:
`brain-character.role` is the brain's job, `anchor-profile.role` is the owner's concise
working identity, `headline` is the owner's public-facing statement, and
`positions[].title` belongs to one organization.

### Import pipeline

A staged pipeline, mirroring the existing `directory-sync` ETL shape and the `stock-photo`
external-API plugin template:

```
SOURCES (pluggable adapters)          TRANSFORM              SINK
────────────────────────────          ─────────              ────
① MDP Snapshot API   (EEA)   ─┐
② Export ZIP upload  (non-EEA)─┼──► deterministic map  ──► merge into anchor-profile
③ MDP Changelog API  (≤28d)  ─┤     + LLM distillation      (singleton, idempotent,
④ OAuth userinfo     (basic) ─┘                              merge-not-clobber)
```

- **Separate structural from semantic translation.** Deterministic key-normalization
  (LI keys → canonical schema) fills the structured record with zero LLM. A distinct,
  optional LLM pass distills presentation fields (`story`, `tagline`, `intro`) _from_ the
  structured record. A source-provided `headline` remains deterministic. Never LLM the
  whole thing inline.
- **Auth is a prerequisite, not the plugin's job.** The plugin consumes a stored token;
  the OAuth consent flow lives at the interface (web) layer. Phase 1–2 use a static token
  in `brain.yaml` (like `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`); the browser callback + refresh is a later
  phase.
- **Write path gotcha.** `SingletonEntityService` has no public setter and
  `AnchorProfileAdapter.createProfileContent()` validates against the _base_ schema
  (strips extension fields). Extension fields must be written by building frontmatter
  directly (the `fromMarkdown` path preserves them), then `refreshCache()` — or via the
  entity's `extendFrontmatterSchema` registration. Confirm the cache-invalidation trigger
  (explicit `refreshCache` vs `entity:updated` subscription) during implementation.

## Phase 1A — Additive professional profile schema

Prepares the import target without breaking existing profiles. Independent of the plugin;
shippable on its own.

Extend `professionalProfileExtension` (`shell/identity-service/src/profile-helpers.ts`)
with provider-neutral, camel-cased professional fields. Base narrative fields (`tagline`,
`intro`, `story`) stay. `headline` is a public professional statement, not a replacement
for the brain's role. The importer maps LI `Headline`→`headline`, `Summary`→`story`, and
`First/Last Name`→`name` only when the corresponding owner-authored value is absent.

New extension fields (all optional):

```
headline        string          (LI: Headline)
industry        string          (LI: Industry)
location        string          (LI: Geo Location)
skills          string[]        (LI: Skills; broad/importable capabilities)
positions       Position[]      (LI: Positions)
education       Education[]      (LI: Education)
certifications  Certification[] (LI: Certifications)

Position:      { companyName, title, description?, employmentType?, location?, startedOn?, finishedOn? }
Education:     { schoolName, degreeName?, fieldOfStudy?, startedOn?, finishedOn?, notes? }
Certification: { name, issuingOrganization?, issuedOn?, expiresOn?, credentialId?, credentialUrl? }
```

`expertise` remains distinct from `skills`: expertise is the owner's curated claim about
areas of authority; imported skills may be broader and noisier. `role`, `currentFocus`,
and `availability` also remain valid owner-profile fields. Existing `audience` and
`desiredTone` remain accepted during the compatibility window, but new code does not use
them as the source of communication behavior. Exact source
keys and partial-date formats must be confirmed against captured Snapshot/export fixtures
before the nested contracts are frozen.

Files:

- `shell/identity-service/src/profile-helpers.ts` — additive schema + nested item schemas
  (explicit `z.ZodObject` types, repo style).
- `shell/identity-service/test/profile-helpers.test.ts` — legacy + new-shape coverage
  (written first).
- `sites/professional/test/professional-profile-schema.test.ts` — assert both curated and
  imported professional fields (written first).
- `sites/professional/src/templates/about.tsx` — render curated Expertise and imported
  Skills distinctly; preserve current-focus/availability rendering.
- `sites/professional/src/templates/homepage-list.tsx` — keep curated expertise as the
  homepage signal; use skills only as a fallback when expertise is absent.

Verify: `bun scripts/lint.mjs --force --filter @brains/identity-service --filter
@brains/site-professional`, then typecheck + `bun test` for both packages.

## Phase 1B — Communication preferences and compatibility migration

Add an optional, explicitly non-profile communication block to brain character:

```
communicationPreferences:
  audience?: string  # default content readership
  tone?: string      # default output/response tone
```

These are defaults, not immutable persona fields: a task, content series, template, or
channel can override them. `brain-character.role` continues to describe the brain's job;
`anchor-profile.role` describes the owner's general professional identity, while
`positions[].title` records organization-specific roles.

Work:

- Extend the brain-character schema/service and instruction builder so communication
  defaults are actually supplied to the agent separately from identity values.
- Change Rover onboarding into three clear concerns: brain identity, owner profile, then
  communication defaults. Stop writing new `audience`/`desiredTone` values to
  `anchor-profile`.
- Preserve legacy profile fields on read/write. Rover's profile capability now runs an
  idempotent migration after plugins are ready, copying
  `anchor-profile.audience`→`brain-character.communicationPreferences.audience` and
  `anchor-profile.desiredTone`→`brain-character.communicationPreferences.tone` only when
  the destination is absent; it does not delete the source fields.
- Keep the public brain-character projection limited to `{ name, role, purpose, values }`
  unless a separate decision intentionally exposes communication defaults.
- Add focused identity-instruction, onboarding, migration, and cache-invalidation tests.

LinkedIn import must neither read nor write communication preferences.

## Phase 2A — `linkedin-import` PROFILE walking skeleton (implemented)

`plugins/linkedin-import` is a ServicePlugin templated on `stock-photo`:

- `env-schema.ts` declares sensitive `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`; the plugin is inert without
  it.
- `lib/linkedin-client.ts` calls the sanctioned Snapshot API with bearer auth and the
  endpoint's fixed `Linkedin-Version: 202312`, validates responses with Zod, follows
  pagination, and bounds surfaced error bodies.
- `lib/transform/registry.ts` provides the domain→mapper seam and currently registers only
  `PROFILE`, the one domain whose exact source keys are documented and captured in-repo.
- `lib/transform/profile-mapper.ts` deterministically maps documented PROFILE keys to
  `name`, `headline`, `industry`, `location`, `website`, and `story`.
- `handlers/linkedin-import-handler.ts` fetches the singleton, fills absent fields or known
  untouched seed placeholders, preserves owner-authored values, uses optimistic
  concurrency, and relies on the normal
  `entity:updated` cache-invalidation path. Re-running unchanged data performs no write.
- `tools/index.ts` exposes the anchor-only, write-marked `linkedin-import_import` tool. Its
  initial call fetches and displays the deterministic merge preview; only the host's typed,
  token-bound confirmation call can queue the import job. The confirmation carries a
  canonical SHA-256 digest of the previewed patch and anchor-profile baseline. Execution
  refetches both and rejects stale approval when either input changed.
- Rover includes the inert capability in each preset and supplies the access token from
  its declared environment schema.

Tests cover the official PROFILE-shaped fixture, API headers/pagination/errors, pure
mapping and merging, idempotent handler behavior, conflict handling, preview and forged or
stale confirmation behavior, tool queuing, and inert/configured plugin wiring.

## Phase 2B — Rich professional domains

The client supports `POSITIONS`, `EDUCATION`, `SKILLS`, and `CERTIFICATIONS`, and the
anchor-only `linkedin-import_inspect_schema` tool reports only source field names, value
types, occurrence counts, record counts, and deduplicated redacted record shapes—never
member values or nested object keys. Safe placeholders distinguish dates, timestamps,
URLs, URNs, emails, and primitive/container types. This provides a privacy-preserving way
to capture real sanctioned API shapes and value-format contracts.

Before enabling those domains for import:

1. Run schema inspection with `domain: "ALL_RICH"` against representative consenting
   accounts (or inspect one domain at a time).
2. Turn the observed contracts into redacted Snapshot/export fixtures.
3. Add one deterministic mapper per domain through the transform registry.
4. Enable each domain only after its mapper passes fixture-backed contract tests. The
   registry is the single enablement point: preview and execution fetch every registered
   domain automatically, while unregistered domains remain inspection-only.

Provider-neutral fingerprints and append-only array merging are already implemented for
skills, positions, education, and certifications. Matching owner-authored records are
preserved rather than enriched or overwritten, while records with new identities append.
Do not guess source keys from display labels or third-party export examples.

## Phase 3 — LLM distillation pass (implemented)

The anchor-only `linkedin-import_distill_profile` tool is an optional, re-runnable second
pass over the current structured profile and imported summary/story. It uses structured AI
generation to propose bounded `tagline`, `intro`, and `story` values, explicitly excludes
`headline` from its output contract, and warns the model to treat profile content as data
rather than instructions.

The proposal is shown in full before the host's typed, token-bound confirmation. Approval
is bound to the anchor-profile content digest; a separate job applies only the reviewed
proposal and rejects stale or concurrent profile edits. The deterministic import path
never invokes this semantic pass.

## Phase 4 — OAuth consent + token refresh (interface layer, in progress)

The service package now exposes a protocol-only `LinkedInOAuthClient` implementing
LinkedIn's documented authorization URL and server-side authorization-code exchange with
the least-privilege `r_dma_portability_3rd_party` scope. It validates token responses,
bounds provider errors, and does not register routes or persist credentials. The importer
accepts a dynamic `LinkedInAccessTokenProvider`, resolves it for each API request, and can
fall back to the existing static token during migration. A future interface can implement
`LinkedInOAuthTokenStore` to both persist exchanged tokens and supply them to the importer.
`FileLinkedInOAuthTokenStore` now implements that contract using the auth-service pattern:
atomic local writes, `0700` storage directory, `0600` token file, strict persisted-shape
validation, explicit disconnect, and expiry-aware reads.

Remaining interface-layer work:

1. Add an operator-authenticated connect route and public callback with expiring,
   single-use state.
2. Instantiate the private-file `LinkedInOAuthTokenStore` from the route layer and inject
   it into the importer, replacing the static `brain.yaml` token. Hosted deployments may
   substitute another approved store through the same contract.
3. Confirm refresh-token availability for `r_dma_portability_3rd_party` in the approved
   LinkedIn application before implementing refresh. LinkedIn's public authorization-code
   contract does not currently document refresh fields, so the client deliberately ignores
   them rather than guessing a refresh contract.
4. Use refresh, if sanctioned, to support scheduled Changelog pulls.

## Phase 5 — Export-ZIP fallback source (non-EEA)

Second source adapter: unpack an uploaded LinkedIn data export, parse the CSVs, feed the
_same_ transform + sink. Selected when the member is not EEA-eligible.

## Later / deferred

- **Changelog sync** — scheduled job (≤28-day cadence) to keep the profile current.
- **Richer entities** — route raw `positions`/`education` to their own homes
  (`portfolio/project`, etc.) and render a timeline on the about page.
- **Connections import** — separate initiative (privacy/consent for others' data).

## Key decisions

- **Target `anchor-profile`, not a new entity** — it already exists in the shell and is
  already consumed; a new profile entity would duplicate it.
- **Provider-neutral canonical fields** — use clear professional vocabulary in repo style;
  LinkedIn adapters translate source keys into it rather than making the durable contract
  mirror one provider's payload.
- **Identity/profile/preferences are separate concerns** — brain character defines the
  brain, anchor profile defines the owner, and communication preferences define default
  readership/tone. LinkedIn import only enriches the owner profile.
- **Additive compatibility window** — retain populated legacy profile fields while new
  consumers move to the clearer contracts; migration is explicit and non-destructive.
- **Single owner token per brain** — each user runs their own brain; no multi-tenancy.
- **Deterministic first, LLM second** — structured record is deterministic; only narrative
  fields use an LLM, as a separate optional pass.
- **DMA API primary (EEA), export-ZIP fallback (rest)** — sanctioned and stable beats
  scraping; both feed one pipeline behind a pluggable-source seam.

## Risks / constraints

- **EEA-only** DMA access — non-EEA owners are export-only until (unless) LinkedIn widens
  portability.
- **Developer-approval gate** — one-time but not instant; start the application early since
  it blocks phases 2–4.
- **28-day Changelog window** — continuous sync must run inside it with a valid (refreshed)
  token.
- **Write-path/cache** — extension-field write + singleton cache invalidation must be
  verified (see Architecture).
- **Preference migration** — legacy profile `audience`/`desiredTone` data remains in place
  after the idempotent copy into brain-character communication preferences; automatic
  source deletion would risk losing user intent.
