# Professional Brain UX Improvements Plan

## Status: Frontend Complete

All frontend UX improvements have been implemented.

### Completed

1. ✅ **CTA Email** - Fixed placeholder in seed-content
2. ~~Home Nav~~ - Skip (logo already links to home)
3. ✅ **Mobile Menu** - Close on link click
4. ✅ **Mobile Menu** - Escape key to close
5. ✅ **Mobile Menu** - Focus trap (Tab stays within)
6. ✅ **Mobile Menu** - Focus management (first link on open, button on close)
7. ✅ **Focus Rings** - Added focus-ring utilities to theme
8. ~~Prose Classes~~ - Skip (inline Tailwind is fine, no benefit to extracting)

## Agent Interaction UX

See **[agent-interaction-ux.md](./agent-interaction-ux.md)** for the test-first implementation plan covering:

- Tool invocation status (show tool names during execution)
- Async job feedback (update responses with job completion)
- Improved confirmation flow (shared utility with more input options)
