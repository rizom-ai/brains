# Brains Project Roadmap

Last Updated: 2025-01-15

## Vision

Build a robust, extensible knowledge management platform that serves as the foundation for individual, team, and collective products.

## Current Status

### Completed âœ…

- **Core Architecture**: Shell-based plugin system with direct registration
- **MCP Integration**: Full MCP server with stdio and HTTP transports
- **Plugin System**: Four plugin types (Core, Service, Interface, MessageInterface)
- **Entity Framework**: Functional entity model with Zod schemas and adapters
- **Conversation Memory**: Conversation tracking and message storage
- **Job Queue**: Background processing with progress tracking and batch operations
- **Content Generation**: Template-based content generation with AI integration
- **Test Infrastructure**: Standardized test harnesses for all plugin types
- **Centralized Permission System**: Single source of truth for user permissions across all interfaces
- **Transport-based MCP Permissions**: Automatic permission levels based on MCP transport type
- **Database Migration System**: Drizzle-based migrations for all databases
- **Separate Databases**: Entity, Job Queue, and Conversation databases separated
- **Structured Logging**: Logger with multiple levels and context support
- **App Package**: Astro-style configuration with defineConfig and handleCLI
- **Directory Sync Plugin**: Import/export entities to/from file system
- **Git Sync Plugin**: Sync entities with Git repositories
- **Site Builder Plugin**: Static site generation with Preact components
- **Topics Plugin**: AI-powered topic extraction from entities
- **System Plugin**: System information and health checks
