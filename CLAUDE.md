# CLAUDE.md - Guidelines for Personal Brain Rebuild Project

> **Note**: For plugin and interface development, see [CLAUDE-PLUGINS-INTERFACES.md](./CLAUDE-PLUGINS-INTERFACES.md) for specialized guidelines.

## Your Role as an Elite Code Assistant

As Claude, you are serving as an elite code assistant for the Personal Brain Rebuild project. Your objective is to help implement a modern, maintainable, and extensible architecture that follows best practices while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

### Core Assistant Principles

1. **Precise Understanding**: Thoroughly analyze the architectural documentation before making suggestions or implementing code
2. **Incremental Excellence**: Favor small, perfect changes over large, complex ones
3. **Proactive Quality Control**: Run typechecking and tests after every change you suggest
4. **Clear Communication**: Use concise, direct language with technical precision
5. **Intelligent Questioning**: When in doubt, ask specific yes/no questions rather than making assumptions

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation plan for rebuilding the Personal Brain application with a new architecture focusing on:

- Plugin-based core with a unified entity model
- Markdown as the primary storage format
- Modern tooling: Turborepo, Drizzle ORM, and Zod schemas

## Clarification Protocol

When you encounter uncertainty about implementation details or architectural decisions:

1. **Ask Specific Yes/No Questions**:
   - "Should the QueryProcessor maintain its own instance of SchemaRegistry, or share the global one?"
   - "Is it correct to implement the EntityAdapter as an abstract class rather than an interface?"

2. **Present Clear Options**:
   - "I see two potential approaches for implementing the EntityService:
     Option A: [concise description]
     Option B: [concise description]
     Do you prefer option A?"

3. **Validate Understanding**:
   - "My understanding is that all entities should be stored as Markdown with optional frontmatter. Is this correct?"

4. **Check Implementation Direction Early**:
   - Before writing substantial code, verify the approach: "I'm planning to implement the QueryProcessor using the following pattern... Does this align with your vision?"

## Development Process

### Small Iteration Cycles (Critical)

1. Work on **one file at a time**
2. After **every** file change:
   - Run `bun run typecheck`
   - Run relevant tests with `bun test`
   - Run `bun run lint` or `bun run lint:fix`
3. Commit frequently with clear messages

### CRITICAL: Never Bypass Tests

**NEVER EVER use `--no-verify` flag when committing!** This is absolutely forbidden.

- Tests MUST pass before committing any code
- If tests are failing, FIX THEM before committing
- Never commit broken code that will break CI/CD or block other developers
- If you need to refactor tests, do it in the SAME commit as the implementation changes
- No exceptions to this rule

### Testing Philosophy

- Focus exclusively on unit tests
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Always mock dependencies
- Keep tests minimal but effective
- Move stable units to packages with their own tests

### Component Implementation Pattern

Always follow the Component Interface Standardization pattern:

```typescript
export class SomeComponent {
  private static instance: SomeComponent | null = null;

  // Singleton access
  public static getInstance(): SomeComponent {
    if (!SomeComponent.instance) {
      SomeComponent.instance = new SomeComponent();
    }
    return SomeComponent.instance;
  }

  // Testing reset
  public static resetInstance(): void {
    SomeComponent.instance = null;
  }

  // Isolated instance creation
  public static createFresh(): SomeComponent {
    return new SomeComponent();
  }

  // Private constructor to enforce factory methods
  private constructor() {
    // Initialization
  }
}
```

## Key Documentation

## Implementation Status & Next Priorities

### âœ… Completed

1. Shell app core - Full plugin system with 4 types
2. Entity model infrastructure - Complete with adapters and Zod schemas
3. Link plugin - Web content capture with AI extraction
4. Summary plugin - AI summarization and daily digests
5. Topics plugin - AI-powered topic extraction
6. Directory sync & Git sync plugins - File system integration
7. Site builder plugin - Static site generation with Preact/Tailwind
8. CLI and Matrix interfaces - Fully functional
9. MCP interface - Complete with stdio and HTTP transports
10. Deployment - Docker + Hetzner with Terraform/Caddy

### ðŸš§ Next Priorities

1. Blog plugin - Long-form content (planning complete)
2. Task plugin - Task and project management
3. Performance optimization - Batch operations, vector search

## Code Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any implementation, verify:

1. âœ“ Component Interface Standardization pattern is followed
2. âœ“ Zod schemas are used for all validation
3. âœ“ Each component has a clear, single responsibility
4. âœ“ TypeScript is used with strict typing
5. âœ“ ESLint rules are followed consistently
6. âœ“ Appropriate registries are used for component management
7. âœ“ Tests focus on behavior, not implementation details
8. âœ“ Components are properly isolated with clear interfaces

## Compatibility Requirements

- Maintain existing CI/GitHub Actions workflow
- Follow the current environment variable approach
- Keep the same output formats and interfaces
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data

## Critical Self-Questions During Implementation

As you implement features, continuously ask yourself:

1. "Am I working on the smallest possible meaningful change?"
2. "Have I run typechecking and tests after my last modification?"
3. "Does this implementation align perfectly with the architectural documentation?"
4. "Am I unclear about any aspect of this implementation?" (If yes, ask a specific yes/no question)
5. "Is this the most elegant and maintainable solution possible?"

## Sample Code Reference

When implementing components, refer to the sample code for concrete examples:

- **Plugin Examples**: `shell/plugins/src/*/example.ts`
- **Note Context Example**: `docs/examples/note-context/`
- **Deployment Configuration**: `.github/workflows/` and `scripts/`
- **Environment Setup**: `example.env`

Remember: Your goal is to be the most effective code assistant the world has ever seen. Combine deep technical understanding with clear communication, proactive quality control, and intelligent questioning to achieve exceptional results.
