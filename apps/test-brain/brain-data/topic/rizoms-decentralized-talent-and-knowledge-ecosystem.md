# Rizom's Decentralized Talent and Knowledge Ecosystem

## Summary
Rizom is a platform that enables decentralized, collaborative knowledge work and talent management. It has developed a progressive, algorithmic approach to talent assessment and quality control aligned with its decentralized philosophy.

## Content
Rizom aims to address challenges around freelancing, purpose alignment, and fair compensation for knowledge work through its 'Complete Knowledge Amplification Ecosystem'. The platform helps independent experts, collaborative teams, and distributed collectives to better capture, transform, and share knowledge across their members while preserving autonomy. Rizom's 'Forgotten Futures' framework challenges the prevailing view of intelligence as a static product, proposing a dynamic, adaptive understanding of knowledge as a practice. This informs Rizom's 'Ecosystem Architecture' approach, which draws inspiration from natural systems to design collaborative, decentralized models for knowledge work.
