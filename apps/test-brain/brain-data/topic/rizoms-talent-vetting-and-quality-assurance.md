## Content

At Rizom, we've developed a robust talent vetting and quality assurance process that is central to our decentralized ecosystem. This process has three key components: 1) Peer-Reviewed Profiles - Each Rizom expert creates a detailed profile that is peer-reviewed by other experts to validate claims and provide feedback. 2) Algorithmic Reputation Scoring - We use advanced algorithms to continuously monitor the quality of work delivered by each expert, analyzing factors like client feedback and on-time delivery. Experts with strong reputations are prioritized. 3) Collaborative Quality Checks - For larger projects, clients can assemble customized teams of experts who then collaborate to review each other's work and provide real-time quality assurance.
