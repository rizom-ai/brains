## Description

An overview of the Omarchy, a decentralized governance model for coordinating complex adaptive systems.

## Summary

The Omarchy Manual provides a detailed introduction to the Omarchy, a novel governance model designed to coordinate complex adaptive systems. The Omarchy is a decentralized, self-organizing system that leverages distributed decision-making and emergent coordination to tackle challenging problems. The manual covers the key principles, structures, and processes that underpin the Omarchy, including holonic organization, stigmergy, and dynamic teaming. It also explores how the Omarchy can be applied to domains like technology development, urban planning, and social impact initiatives. The goal is to equip readers with a deep understanding of this innovative approach to collective intelligence and collective action.
