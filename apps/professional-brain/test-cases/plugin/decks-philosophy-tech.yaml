      STYLE CHECKLIST (score harshly if violated):
      - Title: Short and evocative, NOT long descriptive titles
      - Has a clear narrative arc (not just bullet point lists)
      - Includes philosophical quotes or references (Heidegger, Kittler, de Certeau, Sloterdijk)
      - NO generic hypothetical examples ("imagine a company that...")

      CONTENT EVALUATION:
      1. Makes genuine connections between philosophy and software (not superficial)
      2. Addresses questions about knowledge, community, and meaning in digital systems
      3. Has intellectual depth without being inaccessible
      4. Reflects a builder's perspective, not just academic theory

      The presenter came to technology through philosophy and believes "the most
      interesting questions about knowledge, community, and meaning were no longer
      being asked in academia" but answered by people building digital infrastructure.
