      STYLE CHECKLIST (score harshly if violated):
      - Title: Short and evocative, NOT long descriptive titles
      - Has a clear narrative arc (not just bullet point lists)
      - Includes quotes or cultural references where appropriate
      - NO generic hypothetical examples ("imagine a company that...")

      CONTENT EVALUATION:
      1. Demonstrates expertise in ecosystem architecture concepts
      2. Uses the living systems vs machines framing appropriately
      3. Includes practical insights, not just theory
      4. Feels like it could be given by someone with philosophy + tech background

      The presenter (Yeehaa) describes their practice as "designing and cultivating
      organizations as if they were living systems rather than machines" and draws
      on Afrofuturism, Shanzhai culture, DAOs, and mesh networks.
