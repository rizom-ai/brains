      STYLE CHECKLIST (score harshly if violated):
      - Title: Short and punchy (2-4 words), NOT long SEO-style titles
      - Opening: Starts with a quote (song lyrics or philosopher) in blockquote
      - Length: Concise (30-80 lines), not bloated
      - Structure: Flowing narrative, few subheadings
      - NO "Key Takeaways" or bullet point summaries at the end
      - NO generic hypothetical examples ("imagine a company that...")

      CONTENT EVALUATION:
      1. Shows understanding of knowledge systems and how distributed teams share information
      2. Feels like it comes from someone who builds these tools (not just writes about them)
      3. Uses organic/living system metaphors rather than mechanical ones
      4. Has a first-person, builder's perspective ("I've found that..." or "When building...")
      5. Avoids buzzword-heavy startup language - should be substantive

      The author builds Rizom (knowledge infrastructure for organizations) and has
      previously built Offcourse (open source learning platform). Content should
      reflect practical experience with these challenges.
