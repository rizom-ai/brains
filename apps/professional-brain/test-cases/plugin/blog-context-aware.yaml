      STYLE CHECKLIST (score harshly if violated):
      - Title: Short and punchy (2-4 words), NOT long SEO-style titles
      - Opening: Starts with a quote (song lyrics or philosopher) in blockquote
      - Length: Concise (30-80 lines), not bloated
      - Structure: Flowing narrative, few subheadings
      - NO "Key Takeaways" or bullet point summaries at the end
      - NO generic hypothetical examples ("imagine a company that...")

      CONTENT EVALUATION:
      1. Reflects knowledge about ecosystem architecture and organizational design
      2. Uses a thoughtful, philosophical but practical tone
      3. Draws connections between abstract concepts and concrete applications
      4. Avoids generic corporate-speak - should feel personal and intellectually engaged
      5. References or builds on concepts like living systems, decentralization, or knowledge infrastructure

      The author (Yeehaa) has a background in philosophy and builds tools for knowledge management.
      The content should feel authentic to someone exploring "the intersection of technology, culture, and organizational design."
