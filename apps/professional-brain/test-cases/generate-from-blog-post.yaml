    # Building Resilient Microservices

    Microservices architecture has become the standard for building scalable applications.
    However, building resilient microservices requires careful consideration of failure modes.

    ## Key Principles

    1. Design for failure - assume every dependency can fail
    2. Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
    3. Use bulkheads to isolate critical components
    4. Add retry logic with exponential backoff

    ## Conclusion

    Building resilient systems takes effort upfront but pays dividends when things go wrong.
    Start with these patterns and iterate based on your specific needs.
