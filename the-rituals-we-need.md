# The Ritual Dimension: How New Institutions Are Built Through Shared Practice

We have forgotten something essential about institutions. We design them as machines—flow charts and org charts, policies and procedures—when what we actually need are ceremonies.

Think about it: the most resilient institutions in history weren't held together by rules. They were held together by rituals. The daily mass that structured medieval monastic life. The morning briefing that synchronized military units. The quarterly all-hands that still echoes through tech companies, even as everything else about work has fragmented. These practices created something rules alone could never achieve: a shared temporal rhythm, a collective body moving in synchrony, a sense that _we_ are something more than individuals pursuing separate interests.

The irony is that we've spent decades stripping institutions of their ritual dimension. We call it modernization. We call it efficiency. We eliminate the ceremonies, the symbols, the repeated practices that bound people together—and then we're shocked when our organizations feel hollow, when people don't know what they belong to, when loyalty evaporates.

If we want to build new institutions that actually work like living systems rather than machines, we need to reclaim the ritual dimension. Not as nostalgia, but as fundamental infrastructure.

## What Rituals Actually Do

Let me start with what rituals are not. They're not decoration. They're not optional. They're not the soft stuff that comes after the "real work" is done.

Rituals are technologies of meaning-making. They're how collectives create shared reality.

The French theorist Georges Bataille understood this deeply. In his work on community and sacrifice, Bataille argued that what binds people together isn't rational interest—it's expenditure, excess, the willingness to spend energy and resources on something that has no direct utility. A ritual is exactly this: time spent together doing something that doesn't produce profit, doesn't move the needle on quarterly metrics, doesn't optimize anything.

When a team gathers for a morning standup, they're not really there to share information—you could do that in a Slack message. They're there to synchronize, to affirm that they exist as a collective, to practice being together. The information is almost secondary. What matters is the gathering itself.

Walter Benjamin saw this in his work on history and tradition. He understood that meaning doesn't exist in some abstract realm—it's created and recreated through repetition, through the ritualistic return to shared symbols and practices. Every time a community repeats a ritual, they're not just remembering the past; they're reconstituting themselves in the present.

Friedrich Kittler, the media theorist, went further. He argued that institutions are fundamentally _media systems_—they're technologies for storing, transmitting, and organizing information and power. But here's the key insight: rituals are the media through which institutions actually exist. The institution doesn't exist in the org chart; it exists in the repeated practices that make people feel like they belong to something real.

When you strip away the rituals, you don't get a more efficient institution. You get a ghost. You get people showing up to a place that has no meaning, following rules that feel arbitrary, serving purposes they don't understand.

## The Contemporary Crisis of Ritual

We live in an era of ritual impoverishment. This is particularly acute in modern organizations.

Traditional institutions had elaborate ritual calendars. The church had the liturgical year. Military organizations had ceremonies of rank and passage. Even corporations, in their heyday, had rituals: the company picnic, the retirement dinner, the annual meeting where leadership addressed the troops. These weren't quaint additions—they were the substance of institutional life.

We've systematized most of this away. The company picnic got outsourced to a HR contractor who manages it as a line item. The all-hands meeting became a quarterly Zoom call where people mute themselves. Retirement ceremonies became a gift card and a LinkedIn post. We optimized the ritual out of institutions and wondered why they felt dead.

The pandemic accelerated this process dramatically. When everything went remote, we didn't lose the ability to work together—we lost the rituals that made work feel like belonging to something. Zoom standups aren't standups; they're surveillance theater. You can't have a coffee break with someone you've never met in person. The informal moments where institutional culture actually gets transmitted—the hallway conversations, the lunch table dynamics, the unstructured time where people learn what the organization actually values—all of that evaporated.

Some organizations tried to recreate rituals in digital space. Virtual happy hours. Online meditation sessions. Slack channels dedicated to sharing pets and memes. These weren't failures of execution; they were failures of understanding. You can't just translate a ritual from one medium to another and expect it to work. A ritual is always embedded in a specific material context, a specific temporality, a specific gathering of bodies.

What we're left with is a generation of workers who have never experienced institutional ritual. They've never felt the synchronization that comes from moving together with others toward a shared purpose. They've never experienced the kind of belonging that rituals create. And then we're confused when they don't feel loyalty to their organizations, when they job-hop constantly, when they see work as purely transactional.

## Ritual as Regenerative Practice

Here's where it gets interesting: the institutions we're trying to build—the ones that work like living systems, that are regenerative rather than extractive, that prioritize flourishing over growth—these need rituals more than traditional institutions ever did.

Why? Because living systems don't stay alive through rules and incentives. They stay alive through constant regeneration, through cycles of renewal, through the circulation of energy and meaning. Rituals are how this circulation happens.

Think about an ecosystem. It's not held together by a management structure. It's held together by cycles—the water cycle, the nutrient cycle, the cycle of predation and growth. Each cycle is, in a sense, a ritual: a repeated pattern that regenerates the system. When you disrupt these cycles, the ecosystem collapses, even if all the individual organisms are still present.

The same is true for human communities. You can have all the right policies, all the right incentives, all the right structural design—and still have a dead institution if you don't have the rituals that regenerate it, that remind people why they're here, that create the conditions for meaning to circulate.

Contemporary examples bear this out. Look at the most resilient communities—the ones that have survived multiple crises, that have maintained coherence across distributed networks, that have actually managed to build alternatives to extractive systems. They all have rich ritual lives.

The Zapatista communities in Chiapas don't just have democratic structures; they have ceremonies and gatherings that affirm their commitment to collective decision-making. Mutual aid networks don't just exchange goods; they gather together regularly in ways that reinforce solidarity. The most effective activist movements don't just have tactical coordination; they have rituals—protest marches, vigils, affinity group practices—that bind people to the cause and to each other.

Even in the tech world, the most innovative companies tend to be the ones that have strong ritual cultures, even if they don't always recognize it as such. The daily standup at Spotify. The weekly all-hands at Stripe. The quarterly off-sites at Figma. These aren't just scheduling decisions; they're ritual infrastructure.

## The Design of Ritual: Structure and Spontaneity

Here's where it gets tricky, though. Rituals can't be designed the way you design a policy. They have to emerge from actual practice. But they also can't just be left to spontaneity, or they'll dissipate.

This is the central tension in creating rituals for new institutions: how do you create the conditions for meaningful ritual to emerge without controlling it so tightly that it becomes performative and hollow?

Bataille's concept of "sovereignty" is useful here. For Bataille, sovereignty isn't about power—it's about the capacity to act without instrumental purpose, to spend energy freely. A genuine ritual has this quality: it's not done _for_ something else; it's done for its own sake, even though it produces real effects. The moment you start designing rituals purely to increase productivity or retention, they cease to be rituals. They become management techniques.

But this doesn't mean you can't create the conditions for ritual to emerge. You can:

**Create temporal containers.** Rituals need time set aside, protected from the pressure of instrumental activity. A weekly gathering time. A monthly ceremony. An annual celebration. These temporal containers signal that something different happens here, that this time is not for productivity but for presence.

**Establish repeated practices.** Rituals work through repetition. The power of a ritual comes not from its novelty but from its familiarity, from the way it creates a groove that people can fall into. This could be as simple as always starting meetings with a moment of silence, or always ending them with a question that invites reflection. The specificity matters less than the consistency.

**Involve the body.** Rituals aren't purely cognitive. They involve movement, gathering, sometimes food or drink or music. This is why Zoom rituals are so difficult—they're trying to create collective meaning through a medium that isolates bodies. When you design rituals for new institutions, think about what bodies are actually doing together.

**Create space for emergence.** The best rituals have a structure but also room for spontaneity. A protest march has a route and a gathering point, but the chants and signs that emerge are unpredictable. A dinner has a menu, but the conversations that happen are not scripted. Design the container, not the contents.

**Make meaning visible.** Rituals often involve symbols—objects, phrases, gestures—that carry meaning. These symbols don't have to be imposed from above. They often emerge from the community itself. But you can create conditions for them to emerge: ask people what matters to them, what they want to remember, what they want to commit to. Let those things become the symbols that your rituals revolve around.

## Real-World Experiments

What does this look like in practice? Let me offer some examples of institutions and movements that are taking the ritual dimension seriously.

**Distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs)** are beginning to understand this. The most successful DAOs aren't the ones with the most sophisticated smart contracts. They're the ones that have created ritual spaces: regular calls where the community gathers, ceremonies for welcoming new members, celebrations of milestones. Gitcoin, for instance, has developed an elaborate ritual calendar around its quarterly grants rounds—not just the mechanics of voting, but the ceremonies of community gathering, the rituals of celebration and reflection.

**Afrofuturist organizations and collectives** have been doing this work for decades. Organizations like Afro-Futurism Inc. and the Black Quantum Futurism Collective have created ritual practices that honor ancestral knowledge while imagining new futures. They understand, as Kittler would put it, that the future isn't something you build through technology alone—it's something you enact through repeated practices that reconstitute what's possible.

**Cooperative movements** have long understood the ritual dimension. Worker cooperatives often have more elaborate decision-making ceremonies than traditional corporations. They gather together regularly, they mark transitions and anniversaries, they create rituals around profit-sharing and collective ownership. These aren't inefficiencies; they're what makes the cooperative actually _feel_ like a collective enterprise rather than just a different ownership structure.

**Learning communities and educational experiments** are rediscovering ritual. Places like Stoa and online learning communities are creating structured rituals around learning: opening ceremonies, closing reflections, seasonal gatherings. These rituals signal that learning isn't just about acquiring information; it's about transformation, about becoming part of a community of practice.

Even within traditional organizations, there are pockets of ritual innovation. Some companies are experimenting with "ritual audits"—looking at what actual rituals exist in their organization and asking whether they're supporting the culture they want to build. Others are being intentional about creating new rituals as they scale: designing ceremonies for onboarding, for celebrating failures, for marking transitions.

## The Philosophical Stakes

Why does this matter philosophically? Because rituals are how we answer the fundamental question: what makes us one?

For most of human history, this question was answered through shared myth, shared religion, shared territory. These answers are no longer available to us. We're building institutions that are radically pluralistic, radically distributed, radically diverse. We can't rely on a shared creation myth or a shared god or a shared homeland.

But we still need to answer the question. What makes us _us_? What binds us together? What prevents our institutions from dissolving into pure atomization?

The answer, I think, is ritual. Not because rituals magically create unity—they don't. But because they create the conditions for unity to emerge. They create a shared temporal rhythm. They give us something to do together. They allow us to practice being a collective.

Benjamin understood this when he wrote about the "Messianic moment"—the idea that history isn't a linear progress but a series of moments where the past and future converge in the present, where something genuinely new becomes possible. Rituals are how we create these moments. Every time we gather and repeat a practice, we're creating a small opening where something beyond the given order becomes possible.

Kittler, in his more pessimistic mode, worried that modern media systems were making genuine ritual impossible—that we were being absorbed into automated systems that precluded the kind of collective presence that rituals require. But I think he was wrong about this. What he was really describing was the absence of intentional ritual design, the loss of the infrastructure that allows rituals to emerge.

Bataille's concept of "inner experience" is also relevant here. For Bataille, inner experience wasn't something private or introspective; it was the experience of exceeding the boundaries of the self, of touching something beyond the individual ego. Rituals create conditions for this kind of experience. They allow us to exceed ourselves, to participate in something larger.

## Building Ritual Infrastructure

So what does this mean for those of us trying to build new institutions?

First, it means taking ritual seriously as infrastructure, not as decoration. When you're designing an organization, a community, a movement, you need to think about ritual design with the same intentionality you bring to governance structures or technical architecture.

Second, it means understanding that rituals can't be imposed. They have to emerge from the actual needs and values of the community. But you can create the conditions for them to emerge: time, space, symbols, repeated practice, intentional gathering.

Third, it means being willing to experiment. Not every ritual will work. Some will feel forced or hollow. The ones that matter will be the ones that your community keeps coming back to, the ones that feel necessary rather than obligatory.

Fourth, it means thinking about the material conditions of ritual. What are people actually doing together? What are they sharing? What symbols matter to them? How does their specific context—their geography, their technology, their history—shape what rituals are possible?

Fifth, it means understanding that rituals change. They're not static. A ritual that worked for your organization at 10 people might not work at 100. A ritual that emerged in a specific moment might need to evolve as your context changes. The point is to stay attuned to what's actually binding people together and to be willing to let rituals transform.

## The Ritual Dimension as Future Infrastructure

Here's what I think is at stake: the institutions that will actually work like living systems, that will be regenerative rather than extractive, that will enable human flourishing rather than just extracting value—these will be the institutions that take the ritual dimension seriously.

Not because rituals are magical or because they solve the hard problems of coordination and resource allocation. But because rituals are how we create the conditions for meaning to circulate, for collective identity to emerge, for people to feel like they belong to something real.

The future of institutional design isn't about better algorithms or flatter structures or more sophisticated incentive mechanisms. It's about understanding institutions as living systems that need to be regenerated constantly through repeated practice, through shared ceremony, through the rituals that allow strangers to become a community.

This is the work ahead: learning to design ritual infrastructure the way we design technical infrastructure, with the same care and intentionality. Not controlling rituals, but creating the conditions for them to emerge. Not imposing meaning, but creating spaces where meaning can be made collectively.

The institutions that figure this out—that understand ritual not as a luxury but as the fundamental technology of collective life—these will be the ones that actually survive, that actually regenerate, that actually become what we need them to be.

Everything else is just machines pretending to be alive.
