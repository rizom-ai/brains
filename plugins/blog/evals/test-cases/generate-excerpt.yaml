  title: "The Art of Code Review"
  content: |
    Code review is one of the most valuable practices in software development.
    It helps catch bugs early, improves code quality, and spreads knowledge
    across the team.

    ## Why Code Review Matters

    When developers review each other's code, they bring fresh perspectives
    and often spot issues that the original author missed. This collaborative
    approach leads to better software and stronger teams.

    ## Best Practices

    1. Keep reviews small and focused
    2. Be constructive, not critical
    3. Review the code, not the person
    4. Use automated tools for style checks

    Code review is an investment that pays dividends in code quality and
    team cohesion.
