      In addition to standard quality criteria, evaluate this deck against these STYLE requirements:

      1. TITLE SLIDE (first slide):
         - Should be ONLY the title - 2-5 words, evocative and memorable
         - Examples of GOOD: "The Hustle Myth", "Breaking Productivity", "Work Smarter Not"
         - Examples of BAD: "A Comprehensive Guide to Productivity", "10 Tips for Being More Productive"
         - Penalize corporate, SEO-optimized, or generic titles

      2. OPENING SLIDE (second slide):
         - Should hook the audience with a provocative question, relevant quote, or bold statement
         - NOT "Welcome to my presentation" or "Today we will cover..."
         - NOT an agenda listing what will be covered

      3. SLIDE STRUCTURE:
         - Minimal text per slide - one idea per slide
         - NO bullet-heavy slides with 5+ items
         - Should tell a story or build an argument, not list features

      4. VOICE:
         - Opinionated and direct, takes clear positions
         - First-person where appropriate
         - NO hedging language ("might", "could potentially", "some experts say")
         - Should NOT sound like a consulting deck or sales pitch

      5. ENDING:
         - NO generic "Questions?" or "Thank you" slides
         - Should end with a call to action or thought-provoking point

      Score QUALITY (0-5) primarily based on how well the deck follows these style guidelines.
      A deck that is technically correct but sounds corporate/generic should score 2-3.
      A deck that matches this distinctive voice should score 4-5.
