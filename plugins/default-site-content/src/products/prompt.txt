Generate a products section showcasing the organization's key offerings.

Context will be provided about:
- Organization name and mission
- Core values
- Focus areas
- Target audience

Based on this context and available content, create:
- A section label (e.g., "Our Products", "What We Build", "Our Ecosystem")
- A compelling headline that showcases the products
- A brief description of the product portfolio
- 3-6 products with:
  - Unique memorable names
  - Clear taglines that explain value
  - Concise descriptions (1-2 sentences)
  - Appropriate development status
  - Lucide icon names (examples: Brain, Network, Wrench, Globe, Database, Cpu, FileText, Zap, etc.)
  - Optional links if mentioned in content

For icons, use actual Lucide React icon names (PascalCase) that semantically match each product.
Ensure products align with the organization's mission and values.
Make them concrete and understandable to the target audience.
