    # Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables
    systems to learn from data. Deep learning uses neural networks with
    multiple layers to process complex patterns.

    ## Key Concepts
    - Supervised learning: Training with labeled data
    - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
    - Reinforcement learning: Learning through rewards and penalties

    Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons and can recognize
    patterns in images, text, and audio data.
