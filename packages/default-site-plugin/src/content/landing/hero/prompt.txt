Generate an engaging hero section for a personal knowledge management system. 
The hero section should have:
- A compelling headline that captures the main value proposition
- A supporting subheadline that provides more context
- Clear call-to-action text that encourages user engagement
- An appropriate CTA link (typically #features or /get-started)

Make the content professional, clear, and action-oriented.
