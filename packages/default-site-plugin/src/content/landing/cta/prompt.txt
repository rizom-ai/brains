Generate a compelling call-to-action section for a personal knowledge management system.
The CTA section should have:
- A persuasive headline that creates urgency or excitement
- A supporting description that reinforces the value
- A primary button object with:
  - "text" field: Action-oriented text (e.g., "Start Free Trial", "Get Started Now")
  - "link" field: Appropriate link (e.g., "/signup", "/demo")
- An optional secondary button object with:
  - "text" field: Alternative action text (e.g., "View Demo", "Learn More")
  - "link" field: Appropriate link

IMPORTANT: Buttons must be proper JSON objects. Example format:
{
  "headline": "Ready to Transform Your Knowledge?",
  "description": "Join thousands who are already building their second brain",
  "primaryButton": {
    "text": "Start Free Trial",
    "link": "/signup"
  },
  "secondaryButton": {
    "text": "View Demo",
    "link": "/demo"
  }
}

Make it compelling and action-oriented. Ensure all button fields are properly formatted JSON objects with "text" and "link" properties.
