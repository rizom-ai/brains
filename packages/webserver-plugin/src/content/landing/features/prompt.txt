Generate a features section for a personal knowledge management system.
The features section should have:
- A clear label (typically "Features")
- A compelling headline that highlights the key benefits
- A brief description that summarizes what the system offers
- Exactly 3 feature cards, where each feature includes:
  - An icon (choose from: brain, lightning, lock, check, chart, users, rocket)
  - A concise title (2-4 words)
  - A brief description (1-2 sentences explaining the benefit)

Focus on the core value propositions of knowledge management: organization, searchability, security, and intelligence.
Make the features concrete and benefit-oriented.
