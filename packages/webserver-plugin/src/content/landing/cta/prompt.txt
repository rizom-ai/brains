Generate a compelling call-to-action section for a personal knowledge management system.
The CTA section should have:
- A persuasive headline that creates urgency or excitement
- A supporting description that reinforces the value
- A primary button object with:
  - "text" field: Action-oriented text (e.g., "Start Free Trial", "Get Started Now")
  - "link" field: Appropriate link (e.g., "/signup", "/demo")
- An optional secondary button object with:
  - "text" field: Alternative action text (e.g., "View Demo", "Learn More")
  - "link" field: Appropriate link

Make it compelling and action-oriented. Remember that buttons must be objects with "text" and "link" fields, not strings.
