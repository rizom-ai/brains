"@rizom/brain": patch
---

Pre-register the built-in site and theme package refs used by bundled brain instances so published-path apps can resolve refs like `@brains/site-rizom`, `@brains/theme-rizom`, `@brains/site-default`, and `@brains/theme-default` from the runtime package registry instead of trying to dynamically import external workspace packages at boot.
